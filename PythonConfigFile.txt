% This is the Python config file of the industrial ecology group at the University of Freiburg
% This script contains the machine-specific paths to run the different model scripts
% On each machine where the model scripts run, this file needs to be copied to the location returned by the Python command    os.path.expanduser("~/PythonConfigFile.txt")
% File syntax: Specifier = value \n  For example: Data_Path_Network_1=K:\Research_Data\ Python scans for '=' and '\n' and takes values from between.
% White spaces at beginning and end are stripped off by Python
% Always end folder path with backslash!
% The following paths work on the machine FNET 1013 (personal laptop of Stefan Pauliuk)
